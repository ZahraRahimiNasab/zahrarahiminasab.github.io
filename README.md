# Biography

I am a Ph.D. graduate frome Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. My PHD research focus was on out-of-distribution detection and reasoning with the application of autonomous vehicles. Previously, I got my Master of Software Engineering and Bachelor of Computer Science from Shahid Beheshti University in Iran.
